When using `webpack` to bundle frontend projects, we always add hash to name of emitted assets so we can safely
give them long term cache after user downloading.

Generally, the hash added to filename is `content hash`(`[name].[contenthash:8].js`). In other words, the hash changes only if the file content changed.

Under this condition, once new version released, users need to download new assets that has it's hash changed.
And the total size of all new assets are cache invalidation size.
