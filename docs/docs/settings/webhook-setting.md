# Webhook Setting

With webhook you can receive event notifications from perfsee on your own server, which is very useful when integrating other services with perfsee.

## Create webhook

Open Project -> `Settings` -> `Webhook` -> `Create`,

![create](/settings/create-webhook.png)

## Receiving payloads

When an event occurs, perfsee will send a `POST` request to the configured url and includes the data involved in the payload.

The following code demonstrates how to build a simple server with express to receive webhook events.

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.post('/callback', express.json(), function (req, res) {
  switch (req.body.eventType) {
    case 'bundle-finished':
    //... your code here
  }
  res.status(204).send()
})

app.listen(3000)
```

> When your server receives a webhook request, it should return a success status code (>= 200 and < 300) as soon as possible. If no response is received for 30 seconds, perfsee will retry the request.

## Validating payloads

To ensure that the webhook request comes from perfsee and prevent others faking the request, you also need to validate the payload.

First you need to set a `secret` in the webhook settings, after that every webhook requests sent by perfsee will contain an `X-Perfsee-Signature-256` header. This is an [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) hex digest for request body, with `sha256=` prefix, typical forms are `sha256=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.

When your server receives a request, you can to use `secret` and the request body to generate a digest and compare it with the digest provided in the header to complete the validation.

The following demonstrates how to validate with express.

```js
const express = require('express')
const crypto = require('crypto')
const app = express()

app.post('/callback', express.text({ type: '*/*' }), function (req, res) {
  const digest = crypto.createHmac('sha256', process.env.SECRET).update(req.body).digest('hex')
  if (req.header('X-Perfsee-Signature-256') === 'sha256=' + digest) {
    const data = JSON.parse(req.body)
    switch (data.eventType) {
      case 'bundle-finished':
      //... your code here
    }
    res.status(204).send()
  } else {
    res.status(400).send()
  }
})

app.listen(3000)
```

## TypeScript definitions

You can find the type definition of webhook in npm package `@perfsee/sdk`.

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { WebhookEvent } from '@perfsee/sdk'

const app = express()

app.post('/callback', express.json(), function (req, res) {
  const json = req.body as WebhookEvent
  console.log(json)
})

app.listen(3001)
```

## POST Example
