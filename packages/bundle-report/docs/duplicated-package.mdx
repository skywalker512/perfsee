It might be possible that a single package gets included multiple times in a Webpack bundle due to different package versions.
This situation may happen without any warning, resulting in extra bloat in your bundle and may lead to hard-to-find bugs.

## Resolving duplicate packages in your bundle

There are multiple ways you can go about resolving duplicate packages in your bundle, the right solution mostly depends on what tools you're using and on each particular case.

### Webpack `resolve.alias`

Add an entry in [`resolve.alias`](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#resolve-alias) which will configure Webpack to route any package references to a single specified path.

For example, if Lodash is duplicated in your bundle, the following configuration would render all Lodash imports to always refer to the Lodash instance found at `./node_modules/lodash`.

```js
alias: {
  lodash: path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/lodash'),
}
```

**Note: Aliasing packages with different major versions may break your app. Use it only if you're sure that all required versions are compatible, at least in the context of your app**

### Yarn `install --flat`

Yarn allows [flat installations](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/install/#toc-yarn-install-flat) (`yarn install --flat`) which will only allow one version of each package to be installed.

### Yarn resolutions

If you want more control over your overridden dependency versions and don't feel like using `yarn install --flat`, yarn supports ["selective version resolution"](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions) which allows you to enforce specific versions for each dependency.

**package.json**

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "4.17.0",
    "old-package-with-old-lodash": "*"
  },
  "resolutions": {
    "old-package-with-old-lodash/lodash": "4.17.0"
  }
}
```

### NPM Dedupe

If you use NPM and not Yarn, you can try running `npm dedupe`. NPM **may** leave multiple versions of the same package installed even if a single version satisfies each [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning) of all of its dependants.

### Bump your dependencies

If your project is using an old version of a package and a dependency is using a newer version of that package, consider upgrading your project to use the newer version.
