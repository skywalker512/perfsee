# API

## Introduction

Perfsee provides open api for public, it based on `GraphQL`, so you need to know the basic language syntax of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) before you can use it.

The API endpoint is `https://perfsee.512.pub/graphql`

:::caution

All API share rate limit to 120 times/minute. Some tasks are triggered by independent rate limit, the result is shown in Response header: `x-ratelimit-limit` and `x-ratelimit-remaining`.

:::

## Authorization

Open api need authorization, please apply API Token on the [Token Management](https://perfsee.512.pub/me/access-token) page.

Click 「Generate new token」

![generate new token](/api/generate-new-token.png)

Enter token name, it should not be the same as existing token, and click 「Create」

![token generated](/api/token-generated.png)

:::caution

**Caution, this dialog will be shown only once**, you CAN'T view the token value after you close the dialog. You can click 「Copy」 to copy the token to clipboard.

:::

## Send Request

After you generated a token, you can send request to open api with header:

```
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

### Example

Here is an example to send an api request using the GraphQL playground:

We would document all the api as much as possible, but some of them may not be well described. You can refer to us and request for an update.
