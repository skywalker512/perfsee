# Chunks
Chunks come in two forms:

- `initial` is the main chunk for the entry point. This chunk contains all the modules and its dependencies that you specify for an entry point.
- `non-initial` is a chunk that may be lazy-loaded. It may appear when dynamic import or SplitChunksPlugin is being used.

Each chunk has a corresponding **asset**. The assets are the output files - the result of bundling.
